# TLC Elixir
A web app to experiment with and validate the RSMP draft specification for traffic light controller fixed-time programs, see:
See https://github.com/rsmp-nordic/tlc_programming for more on the specification.

The app shows a traffic light simulator where you can run and edit traffic light programs.

The app is written in Elixir using the Phoenix framework.
